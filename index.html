							<h2>How agencies act as main player in China's underground surrogacy market</h2>

						<h2>Why China keeps surrogacy a grey area? </h2>
						<p>In mainland China, underground surrogacy market is booming. In 2015, the Amendment to the
							Population and Family Planning Law of the People's Republic of China was enacted.
							(https://www.cecc.gov/resources/legal-provisions/amendment-to-the-population-and-family-planning-law-of-the-peoples)
							The draft initially proposed to forbid any format of surrogacy.
							(http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2015-12/26/content_5028165.htm) But the law that finally got
							passed never mentioned about illegalising surrogacies, leaving surrogacy in an unregulated
							grey area.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The only law that can be referred to is the Administrative Measures for Assisted Human
							Reproductive Technology (http://www.jxszyy.cn/upload/38/u/soft/20180912/1536725282.doc).
							According to Article 3, the application of human assisted reproductive technology shall be
							carried out in medical institutions for the purpose of medical treatment and shall comply
							with the national family planning policy, ethical principles and relevant legal provisions.
							The sale of gametes, zygotes and embryos in any format is prohibited. Medical institutions
							and medical personnel shall not implement any form of surrogacy technology.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							A judge who wished to remain anonymous said that the main purpose to remove this regulation
							could be leaving more room for couples who are incapable of having a child. According to the
							China Population Association, the infertility rate of China has increased by 10% from 2009
							to 2019. “Altruistic surrogacy where a surrogate carries a child with no additional base
							compensation is acceptable. But if a signed contract and unreasonable money and benefits
							exchange are involved in the process, it will be defined as illegal commercial surrogacy,”
							she said.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Does the contract have legal power? </h2>
						<p>
							Talking about the legality of surrogacy contracts, whether the contract is valid or invalid,
							she said that in terms of the current law of our country, it is more likely to be invalid.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							According to the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China Article 52
							(https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/52923/108022/F1916937257/CHN52923%20Eng.pdf),
							a contract shall be null and void under any of the following circumstances:
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							<li>
								<ul>
									(1) a contract is concluded through the use of fraud or coercion by one party to
									damage
									the interests of the State;
								</ul>
								<ul>
									(2) malicious collusion is conducted to damage the interests of the State, a
									collective or a third party;
								</ul>
								<ul>
									(3) an illegitimate purpose is concealed under the guise of legitimate acts;
								</ul>
								<ul>
									(4) damaging the public interests;
								</ul>
								<ul>
									(5) violating the compulsory provisions of laws and administrative regulations.
								</ul>
							</li>
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							There is no direct law stating that all surrogacy agreements are void. However, the
							surrogacy cases in China may relate to sex selection. If this is the case, it is a clear
							violation of the family planning law.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							An agency called New Life Global Network provides their sample contract between agency and
							intended parents
							(https://www.surrogacyasia.com/zh/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/surrogacy-contract-%E5%8A%A9%E5%AD%95%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%89%88.pdf)
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							According to Chenggang Ji, a lawyer from Beijing, the contract is in accordance with
							Cambodian legislation and cannot be explained by Chinese laws. He confirmed that if a
							contract is stated as void, both parties are not protected by law. Another aspect that
							should be taken into consideration is public order or good morals, which has been used in
							multiple lawsuits regarding dispute over surrogacy contracts.
