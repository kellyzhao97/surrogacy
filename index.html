						<p>Ying, living in GuangZhou, China, firstly joined the surrogacy industry as an assistant in
							2011. Now, she already formed her own surrogacy “team” to assist agencies with taking care
							of surrogate mothers, who are also called volunteers within the industry. All logistics from
							accommodation, meals, medical care to purchasing maternity clothes are managed by Ying and
							her team during the full-term pregnancy of the carriers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Surrogate is a controversial topic with its legality varying widely around the world. The
							ambiguous law in China has stimulated this booming industry over the past 10 years. Ying’s
							team is a part of this huge remunerative underground surrogate industry in China, which is
							estimated to encompass over 400 agencies.
						</p>
						<h2>How legal loopholes help market growth?</h2>
						<p>In 2015, <a
								href="https://www.cecc.gov/resources/legal-provisions/amendment-to-the-population-and-family-planning-law-of-the-peoples">the
								Amendment to the Population and Family Planning Law of the People's Republic of
								China</a> was enacted. The <a
								href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2015-12/26/content_5028165.htm">draft</a>> initially
							proposed to forbid any format of surrogacy. But the
							law that finally got passed never mentioned about illegalising surrogacies, leaving
							surrogacy in an unregulated grey area, neither explicitly prohibited nor supported.
						</p>
						<p>
							The only law that can be referred to is <a
								href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/fzs/s3576/201808/99ad3444a14340e79c8361ee23b96251.shtml">the
								Administrative Measures for Assisted Human
								Reproductive Technology</a>. According to Article 3, the application of human assisted
							reproductive technology shall be carried out in medical institutions for the purpose of
							medical treatment and shall comply with the national family planning policy, ethical
							principles and relevant legal provisions. The sale of gametes, zygotes and embryos in any
							format is prohibited. Medical institutions and medical personnel must not implement any
							format of surrogacy technology.
						</p>
						<p>
							A judge who wished to remain anonymous said that the main purpose to remove this regulation
							could be to leave more room for couples who are incapable of having a child. According to
							the China Population Association, the infertility rate of China has increased by 10% from
							2009 to 2019.
						</p>
						<p>
							“Altruistic surrogacy, where a surrogate carries a child with no additional base
							compensation, is acceptable. But if a signed contract and unreasonable money or benefit
							exchange are involved in the process, it will be defined as illegal commercial surrogacy,”
							she explained.
						</p>
						<p>
							And such illegality could bring about the invalidity of the contract.
						</p>
						<h2>Why are contracts invalid? </h2>
						<p>
							According to <a
								href="https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/52923/108022/F1916937257/CHN52923%20Eng.pdf">Article
								52 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China</a>, a contract shall
							be null and void under any of the following circumstances:
							<ul>
								(1) a contract is concluded through the use of fraud or coercion by one party to
								damage
								the interests of the State;
							</ul>
							<ul>
								(2) malicious collusion is conducted to damage the interests of the State, a
								collective or a third party;
							</ul>
							<ul>
								(3) an illegitimate purpose is concealed under the guise of legitimate acts;
							</ul>
							<ul>
								(4) damaging the public interests;
							</ul>
							<ul>
								(5) violating the compulsory provisions of laws and administrative regulations.
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							There is no direct law stating that all surrogacy agreements are void. The judge also
							pointed out one of the exceptions where the surrogacy cases are related to sex selection. If
							this is the case, it is a clear violation of the family planning law.
						</p>
						<p>
							An agency called New Life Global Network provides their <a
								href="https://www.surrogacyasia.com/zh/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/surrogacy-contract-%E5%8A%A9%E5%AD%95%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%89%88.pdf">sample
								contract</a> between agency and
							intended parents on their website and refused our inquiry of interview. According to
							Chenggang Ji, a lawyer from Beijing, the contract is in accordance with Cambodian
							legislation and cannot be explained by Chinese laws. He confirmed that if a contract is
							stated as void, both parties are not protected by law. </p>
						<p>
							“The contracts between agency and surrogates are legally invalid, which is known by all the
							agencies,” admitted by Ying. However, people in the industry still sign contracts to make
							the surrogates feel partly in control of the deal.
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing the invalidity, Ying seldom signed contracts with surrogates. Her usual practice was
							to conclude the business with a gentleman’s oral agreement. But it did not go well. She
							learned her lesson when surrogate mothers asked for a higher price when they got pregnant.
							Therefore, she decided to make formal contracts in the future to take back control.
						</p>
						<h2>Ethical dilemmas posed by surrogacy</h2>
						<p>
							Another aspect that should be taken into consideration in lawsuit prosecution is public
							order or good morals, which has been applied in settling multiple lawsuits regarding dispute
							over surrogacy contracts. Ethical dilemmas to surrogate parenthood have posed challenges to
							humanity.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to Ji, there are three types of surrogacy. First, parents transfer their own
							fertilized eggs to the surrogate mother for implantation. In this case, the surrogate mother
							is a complete "surrogacy", and the child has no genetic relationship with the surrogate
							mother. Second, the father uses artificial way (not sexual intercourse) to inject semen into
							the surrogate mother. In this case, the child has a genetic relationship with the surrogate
							mother, which is recognized by Chinese law as a mother-child relationship. Third, through
							sexual intercourse, the father makes the surrogate mother pregnant and give birth. From Ji’s
							opinion, surrogacy agreements based on second and third way should be void.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ji acknowledged that there are blanks in the legislation dealing with surrogacy related
							disputes, but these legal blanks are very common in China, or in other countries. The
							Council on General Affairs and Policy of the Hague Conference are currently working on a
							<a
								href="https://www.hcch.net/en/projects/legislative-projects/parentage-surrogacy ">project</a>>
							to reach a global agreement but it’s difficult to have actual power over surrogacy
							because of countries’ wide differences.

						<p>From 2005 to 2019, 240 surrogacy relevant lawsuits were documented regarding validity of
							surrogacy contract, parenthood of the surrogate child, sole care and control of the
							surrogate
							child.</p>
						<h2>How can agencies keep surrogates without a valid contract?</h2>
						<p>
							A contract having no legal power protects neither of the two parties. Surrogate mothers can
							be cheated by the agencies and fail to get their promised payment or medical treatments. The
							agencies have no legal rights to intervene when surrogates decide to terminate the pregnancy
							and go back home. However, they have come up with other methods to restrict surrogates.
						</p>
						<P>
							For instance, in order to ensure all the surrogate mothers to complete the entire process,
							their ID card will be confiscated by Ying. They will not be able to purchase train tickets
							or airline tickets back home without their ID.
						</P>
						<p>
							Apart from that, paying in installments is a typical way in the industry to prevent
							surrogates from regretting their decisions and running away without giving birth. According
							to Shanghai Xibei, the payment will be made in a mix of various forms, such as monthly base
							pay, compensation, medical compensation. A base salary of 2,000 yuan will be paid in monthly
							installments after the fertilized egg is successfully implanted. There will be an additional
							monthly 10,000 yuan compensation starting from the third month of pregnancy. The amount will
							increase to 15,000 yuan from the sixth month of pregnancy and the rest unpaid compensation
							will be settled after intended parents successfully pick up the baby from the hospital.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most surrogate mothers won’t risk the loss of money to escape though. One of the surrogate
							agencies, called Shanghai Xibei, offers 10,000 yuan for egg donors, but up to 180,000 yuan
							for surrogates. Last year, the annual per capita income of rural households in China was
							only 15,000 yuan. This considerable payment attracts women from less-developed provinces to
							go to major cities to bear children for others.
						</p>
						<p>
							And she said it’s low season of the industry now, starting from October, as many surrogate
							mothers are preparing to return home to spend the Chinese New Year with their own families.
							But the peak season is soon to come, after the New Year, more babies and business are yet to
							come.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even though many surrogate agencies promotes that they provide well-educated carriers
							graduated from university, most of the carriers that Ying has encountered are middle-aged
							women from rural China. “Only rarely do university students suspend their studies to earn
							money this way,” Ying said. “Most young students choose to donate their eggs instead of
							being a carrier, and only those badly in need of money opt for surrogacy.”
						</p>

						<a href="#" class="image featured">
							<img src="images/1.png" alt="" />
						</a>
						<p>As Ying said, volunteers are mostly middle-aged women from rural China. The pic shows
							someone posted on the baidu IVF forum volunteering to be a carrier due to poor family
							condition and multiple kids to raise.
						</p>
						<h2>How do agencies work in the industry?</h2>
						<iframe title="Surrogacy" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-QB2Ld"
							src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QB2Ld/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
							style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="675"></iframe>
						<script
							type="text/javascript">!function () { "use strict"; window.addEventListener("message", function (a) { if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"]) for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) { var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']"); t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px") } }) }();</script>
						<p>Surrogacy agencies are highly profitable and charge approximately 400-800k RMB for the
							service.</p>
						<p>
							The agencies normally will rent an apartment to accommodate surrogates in these major
							cities. They also have designated partner “medical laboratory” for surrogates to do the
							medical check-ups, which are usually completed by medical personnel who have left their
							previous jobs in medical institutions.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, some people in the industry told reporters from <a
								href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/legal/2019-07/16/c_1124756957.htm">Xinhua News Agency</a>
							that although
							the donors received a compensation fee, there were actually huge hidden dangers. The egg
							retrieval operation in regular hospitals requires high environmental requirements, and must
							be sterile and constant temperature. Most underground surrogates often seek out black
							clinics to retrieve eggs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Due to lack of supervision, there are risks such as incomplete disinfection, repeated use of
							equipment, and irregular operations. If the egg is taken out of the follicle, it is
							necessary to pierce the ovary, leaving a wound on the ovary. If the indoor bacteria exceed
							the standard, a genital tract infection may occur and cause pelvic inflammatory disease,
							which will affect future fertility. Infectious diseases such as AIDS may even be life
							threatening due to infection.
						</p>
						<h2>Who’s in charge of the unsupervised agencies?</h2>
						<p>
							In 2015, two couples sued Fu Xiaoxia, a former employee of Shanghai HuDa Investment
							Management Company with contract fraud as she charged tens of thousands as surrogacy service
							fee and surrogate mother compensation using fake pregnancy test reports and concealed the
							fact of her quitting job in 2011. Fu later was sentenced to three and a half years in prison
							with a fine of 10000 yuan. However, HuDa Investment Company was not punished and even
							survived till liquidation in 2018, though proved to be a surrogacy agency with concrete
							evidence during investigation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Looking into the profile of HuDa’s owner, Xu Hua, two more medical companies were
							established and managed by him, named both Qi Jian Medical Technology Company but located
							perspectively in Fujian and Shanghai. The companies are licensed for technology development
							and consultation but turn out to be a surrogate agency named Kun He as shown on <a
								href="http://www.pacgenomics.cn/">its official
								website.</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							Though the equivocalness in law allows the existence of agencies in the format of sham
							companies like Qi Jian ,still no legal protection can be promised for the contract due to
							the illegality of surrogacy business.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ying tries to destigmatize surrogacy. Having spent around 8 years in the industry. She said
							she built a great friendship with surrogate mothers. Even though they hold surrogates’ ID
							cards, it is not detaining. “Unlike what most people think, there are no abuse or unfair
							treatments to surrogate mothers. This serves the common interest of both intended parents
							and surrogate mother.”
